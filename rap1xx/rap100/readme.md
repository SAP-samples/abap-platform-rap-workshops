## Requirements for attending this workshop 
[^Top of page](#)

> You need the latest version of ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse (ADT) on your laptop or PC as well as the access to an ABAP Environment system to carry out the practical exercises of this workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

You **MUST** have installed the latest version of Eclipse and the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plugin in it.   
 
Please check the following two short documents how to do this if you have not already done it:  
 - [Install the newest Eclipse platform and the newest ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plugin](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-rap-workshops/blob/main/requirements_rap_workshops.md#3-install-the-abap-development-tools-adt)  
 - [Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-rap-workshops/blob/main/requirements_rap_workshops.md#4-adapt-the-web-browser-settings-in-your-adt-installation)  
 
You also need a user on an SAP BTP ABAP environment or SAP S/4HANA 2022 system, e.g. SAP BTP ABAP Environment Trial.   
Please check the following tutorial if you do not have a working account yet:  
 - [Create an SAP BTP ABAP Environment Trial User](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html)

> âš **Please note**âš :    
> Participants of SAP events (e.g. **ABAP Developer Day**) will carry out the various exercises on a dedicated SAP BTP ABAP Environment system set up by SAP for the specific event.

## Overview

> This workshop is all about RAP fundamentals; especially about how to use RAP core features when building greenfield implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
In this hands-on session we will guide you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Travel Processing App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation with semantic key and internal unmanaged early numbering. We will give you more details on the scenario in the different exercises.

The resulting app will look like this:

![Travel App](images/travelapp01.png)

The OData service you are going to implement is based on the _ABAP Flight Reference Scenario_. To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing worldwide Travels for multiple Agencies is requesting you to build a new Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing (i.e. creating, updating and deleting) Travels.

Below is the simplified data model underlying the app.

> **Please note**:   
> The purpose of the different exercises is to show you how to implement the different RAP core features - and less on having the perfect business scenario.
> To remove a certain complexity in the implementation, we will use a very simplified data model with only one BO node, the _Travel_ entity.   
> For implementation examples with more than one BO node, you can have a look at:
> - Workshop **[DEV260](../readme.md)**
> - RAP Development Guide on the SAP Help Portal: **[Develop Applications](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/4cff5dff7f2642cab54e993c840a163e.html)**

## About the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
[^Top of page](#)

> The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) is a set of concepts, tools, languages, and powerful frameworks provided on the ABAP platform. It supports the efficient development of innovative and cloud-ready enterprise applications, as well as the extension of SAP standard applications in an upgrade-stable way in the cloud and on-premise.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

RAP is an enabler for improving the user experience and innovating business processes in ABAP-based SAP solutions by leveraging SAP Fiori, SAP HANA, and the cloud. 
It is a long-term strategic solution for ABAP development on SAPâ€™s flagship product SAP S/4HANA, in the cloud and on-premise (as of release 1909), as well as on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment.


The illustration below shows the high-level end-to-end development stack when working with RAP.

## Exercises
[^Top of page](#)

Follow these steps to build an OData service for developing a transactional, draft-enabled Fiori elements app from scratch using RAP. You will also write an ABAP unit test for it and explore the Entity Manipulation Language (EML).

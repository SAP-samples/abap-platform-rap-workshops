# Exercises 6: Enhance the BO Behavior – Actions 

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've defined and implemented two validations (see [Exercise 5](../ex5/readme.md)).

In the present exercise, you will learn how to add different instance-bound actions (aka instance actions) to your application.
First you will create a non-factory, instance action **`deductDiscount`**, without and with input parameter, to determine the discounted booking fee of a _travel_ instance and the factory instance action **`copyTravel`** to copy a _Travel_ instance. 

As *optional* exercises, you can additionally implement the two non-factory, instance actions **`acceptTravel`** and **`rejectTravel`** to set the overrall status of a _Travel_ instance respectively to _accepted_ (`A`) or _rejected_ (`X`).

> **Please note**: The purpose of the different exercises is to show you how to implement the different action types - and less on having the perfect business scenario.

### Information: Actions
> In the RAP context, an action is a non-standard operation that change the data of a BO instance. 
> 
> Actions are specified in behavior definitions and implemented in ABAP behavior pools. 
> By default, actions are related to instances of a BO entity. The addition `static` allows you to define a static actions that are not bound to any instance but relates to the complete entity.
> 
> Two main categories of actions can be implemented in RAP:  
> - **Non-factory actions**: Defines a RAP action which offers non-standard behavior. The custom logic must be implemented in the RAP handler method `FOR MODIFY`. An action per default relates to a RAP BO entity instance and changes the state of the instance.  An action is related to an instance by default. Non-factory actions can be instance-bound (default) or static.
> - **Factory actions**: Factory actions are used to create RAP BO entity instances. Factory actions can be instance-bound (default) or static. Instance-bound factory actions can copy specific values of an instance. Static factory actions can be used to create instances with prefilled default values.

## Exercise 6.1: Add the Instance-bound Action `deductDiscount`
[^Top of page](#introduction)

> You will now define, implement, and expose the action **`deductDiscount`**, a non-factory instance-bound action returning itself. The action offers the possibility to *deduct a certain percentage from the booking fee* (**`BookingFee`**) of a _Travel_ instance. 
> 
> The discount percentage can either be fix (30% in the present exercise) in the action implementation or be freely specified by the end-user or the calling APIs by offering an action with input parameters.
> 
> You will get familiar with both action implementations, i.e. action without and action with input parameters in the present exercise.  
> 

### Exercise 6.1.1: Define an Instance Action 

> First, define the non-factory, instance action **`deductDiscount`** in the behavior definition of the _Travel_ entity. This action has no input parameter. 

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
1. Go to your behavior definition ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_R_TRAVELTP_###`** and define the instance action without input paramater.
   
   For that, insert the following code snippet after the defined validations as shown on the screenshot below.
   
   ```
     action deductDiscount result [1] $self;
   ```      
   
   The result should look like this:   
   <!-- ![CDS BO Behavior Definition](images/b10.png)  -->
   <img src="images/b10.png" alt="CDS BO Behavior Definition" width="60%">
   
   **Short explanation**:  
   - The name of the instance action is specified after the keyword **`action`**
   - The keyword **`result`** defines the output parameter of the action.
      - Its cardinality is specified between the square brackets (`[cardinality]`). It is a mandatory addition.  
      - **`$self`** specifies that the type of the result parameter is the same type as the entity for which the action or function is defined - i.e. the _Travel_ entity type in the present exercise. The return type of the result parameter can be an entity or a structure.     
    - **Note**: The output parameter **`result`** can be used to store the result of an action or function in an internal table. However, it does not affect the result of an action or function that is committed to the database.   
      
    > ℹ **Further reading**: [Action Definition](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/14ddc6b2442b4b97842af9158a1c9c44.html) 

2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

3. Now, declare the required method in behavior implementation class with the ADT Quick Fix.

   Set the cursor on the action name, **`deductDiscount`**, and press **Ctrl+1** to open the **Quick Assist** view.
  
    Select the entry _**`Add method for action deductDiscount of entity zrap100_r_traveltp_### ...`**_ in the view to add the required method to the local handler class.   

    <!-- ![Travel BO Behavior Definition](images/nn.png) -->
   <img src="images/nn.png" alt="CDS BO Behavior Definition" width="60%">  
      
4. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes.

5. Set the cursor on the method name, **`deductDiscount`**, press **F3** to navigate to the declaration part of the local handler class of the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**.   

   ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/b12a.png)
   <!-- <img src="images/b12a.png" alt="CDS BO Behavior Pool" width="60%">   -->

6. In the declaration part set the cursor on the method name, **`deductDiscount`**, press **F2**, and examine the full method interface.   
      
   <!-- ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/b12b.png)  -->
   <img src="images/b12b.png" alt="CDS BO Behavior Pool" width="60%">   
  
   **Short explanation**:  
   - The addition **`FOR MODIFY`** after the method name, together with the addition **`FOR ACTION`** after the importing parameter, indicates that this method provides the implementation of an action.
   - Method signature for the non-factory instance action `deductDiscount`:
     - `IMPORTING`parameter **`keys`** - a table containing the keys of the instances on which the action must be executed
     - Implicit `CHANGING` parameters (aka _implicit response parameters_):  
       - **`result`** - used to store the result of the performed action.
       - **`mapped`** - table providing the consumer with ID mapping information.
       - **`failed`** - table with information for identifying the data set where an error occurred.
       - **`reported`** - table with data for instance-specific messages.
      
    > 
  
    > **Please note**:  
    > An action is implemented in a **`FOR MODIFY`** method with the addition **`FOR ACTION`**. The signature of an action method always depends on the type of action: factory or non-factory, and instance or static.   
    > The rules for implementing an action operation in a RAP business object are explained in the respective _**Implementation Contract**_.      
    
    > ℹ **Further reading**: [Action Implementation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/6edad7d113394602b4bfa37e07f37764.html)  **|**  [Implementation Contract: Action](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/de6569d4b92e40a0911c926170140beb.html)   
   
    Go ahead with the implementation of the action method.

### Exercise 6.1.2: Implement the Action Method

> Now implement the action behavior in the appropriate method in the behavior pool of the _Travel_ entity.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
1. Implement the action method **`deductDiscount`**.

   The main steps of the implemented business logic:     
   1. Implement the custom logic to determine the new values: The discounted booking fee must be calculated for each instance.   
   2. The discount percentage is fix at the current stage: 30%.  
   3. Modify the relevant fields of the instances with the EML statement **`MODIFY`**: Here only the field **`BookingFee`** must be updated.   
   4. Read the data from the buffer with the EML statement **`READ`** to fill the action result parameter **`result`**.  
   5. The implicit response parameters are filled where necessary:
      - **`failed`** - with information for identifying the data set where an error occurred.
      - **`mapped`** - table providing the consumer with ID mapping information.
      - **`reported`** - with data for instance-specific messages in case of failure.

   Replace the current method implementation with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID. 
   
   You can use the **ABAP Pretty Printer** (**Ctrl+F1**) to format your source code.


   ```ABAP  
   **************************************************************************
   * Instance-bound non-factory action:
   * Deduct the specified discount from the booking fee (BookingFee)
   **************************************************************************
     METHOD deductDiscount.
       DATA travels_for_update TYPE TABLE FOR UPDATE ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###.
       DATA(keys_with_valid_discount) = keys.

       " read relevant travel instance data (only booking fee)
       READ ENTITIES OF ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_### IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
          FIELDS ( BookingFee )
          WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys_with_valid_discount )
          RESULT DATA(travels).

       LOOP AT travels ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<travel>).
         DATA percentage TYPE decfloat16.
         DATA(discount_percent) = keys_with_valid_discount[ KEY draft %tky = <travel>-%tky ]-%param-discount_percent.
         percentage =  discount_percent / 100 .
         DATA(reduced_fee) = <travel>-BookingFee * ( 1 - percentage ) .

         APPEND VALUE #( %tky       = <travel>-%tky
                         BookingFee = reduced_fee
                       ) TO travels_for_update.
       ENDLOOP.

       " update data with reduced fee
       MODIFY ENTITIES OF ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_### IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
          UPDATE FIELDS ( BookingFee )
          WITH travels_for_update.

       " read changed data for action result
       READ ENTITIES OF ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_### IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
          ALL FIELDS WITH
          CORRESPONDING #( travels )
          RESULT DATA(travels_with_discount).

       " set action result
       result = VALUE #( FOR travel IN travels_with_discount ( %tky   = travel-%tky
                                                               %param = travel ) ).
     ENDMETHOD.
   ```

   The result should look like this:

   <!-- ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/n9a.png) -->
   <img src="images/n9a.png" alt="CDS BO Behavior Pool" width="60%">     

   **Short explanation**:  
   - The provided implementation is mass-enabled. This is recommended. 
   - The EML statement **`MODIFY ENTITIES ... UPDATE FIELDS`** is used to update specific fields of the instances.     
   - The internal tables are filled inline using the constructor operator **`VALUE`** which made the need for explicit declaration obsolete.       
   - The EML statement **`READ ENTITIES ... ALL FIELDS WITH CORRESPONDING`** is used to read all fields of the updated instances from the buffer to fill the input paramter `result`.        

2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

### Exercise 6.1.3: Expose and Test the Action

> In contratry to determinations and validations which are automatically called by the RAP runtime at the specified trigger time, actions must be explicitly exposed on the BO projection layer and called by a consumer, e.g. on the UI or directly via EML statements. 
>  
> Now, you will expose the action in the BO behavior projection and enrich the UI semantics in the CDS metadata extension to add an appropriate button to the _Travel_ App.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Expose the action in the BO behavior projection.
   
   Go to your behavior projection ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_C_TRAVELTP_###`** and insert the following code snippet as shown on the screenshot below. 
   
   The keyword **`use action`** indicates that a behavior of the base BO is used on the projection layer.
   
   ```
   use action deductDiscount;
   ```
   
   The result should look like this:

   ![Travel BO Behavior Projection](images/b14.png)
      
2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.  

3. Enhance UI semantics to make the action **`deductDiscount`** only visible on the object page with the label _**Deduct Discount**_. 

   For that, open your metadata extension ![ddlx icon](images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP100_C_TRAVELTP_###`** and replace the existing all **`@UI`** annotation block placed before the element **`OverallStatus`** with the code snippet provided below as shown on the screenshot below. The semantic of the annotation **`@UI.identification`** will be enhanced for the purpose. 
   
   **Please note**: Some lines in the provided code snippet are commented out using **`//`** at the beginning. **DO NOT remove them**. You will uncomment these lines in the following exercise steps.
   
   ```
     @UI: {
         lineItem:       [ { position: 100, importance: #HIGH }                          
                           //,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'copyTravel', label: 'Copy Travel' } 
                           //,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'acceptTravel', label: 'Accept Travel' }
                           //,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'rejectTravel', label: 'Reject Travel' }
              ],
         identification: [ { position: 100 }                          
                          ,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'deductDiscount', label: 'Deduct Discount' } 
                          //,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'acceptTravel', label: 'Accept Travel' }
                          //,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'rejectTravel', label: 'Reject Travel' }
              ],
           textArrangement: #TEXT_ONLY
         }
   ```

   The result should look like this:
   
   <!-- ![Travel CDS Metadata Extension](images/b15.png) -->
   <img src="images/b15.png" alt="Travel CDS Metadata Extension" width="60%">     
   
4. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

5. Preview and test the enhanced Fiori elements App.

   For example, select a _Travel_ entry, navigate to the object page, and click on the new action button _**Deduct Discount**_. Check the action result: the booking fee must have been reduced by the percentage specified in the action method.
   
   ![Travel App Preview](images/preview7.png)
   <img src="images/preview7.png" alt="Travel App Preview" width="70%">        

   If you wish, you can also define the button on the list report page in the CDS metadata extension, activate the changes, and re-test the app.

</details>


### Exercise 6.1.4: Add an Input Parameter
[^Top of page](#introduction)

> You will enhance the action **`deductDiscount`** with an input parameter (**`discount_percent`**) to allow end-users or calling APIs to freely specify the percentage to be deducted from the booking fee (**`BookingFee`**) of a _travel_ instance at runtime.   
>     
> Action input parameters are modeled with abstract CDS entities (_abstract entities_). In the present example, we will use the abstract entity **`/dmo/a_travel_discount`** which defines a structure containing only one field, **`discount_percent`**, for the purpose. It is located in the package `/DMO/FLIGHT_DRAFT` of the _Flight Reference Scenario_. 
  
> ℹ **Info**: An abstract CDS entity defines the type properties of a CDS entity. Consequently, it provides metadata on element level or parameter level using CDS annotations and does not have a corresponding implementation nor an underlying persistency.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
1. Let's have a look at the abstract entity defined in the data definition ![ddls icon](images/adt_ddls.png)**`/DMO/A_Travel_Discount`**. You can use the shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+A** to open the data definition.

   <!-- ![CDS Abstract entity](images/b9.png) -->
   <img src="images/b9.png" alt="CDS Abstract entity" width="60%">  

   **Short explanation**:  
   - An abstract entity is defined by the statement **`define abstract entity`** followed by the CDS entity name. 
   - The current abtract entity defines a structure with only one field or element; The element name (**`discount_percent`**) and the element type (**`abap.int1`**) are specified.
   - It is not here the case, but if required, it is possible to...
      - specify a label using the element annotation `@EndUserText.label`.
      - specify a value help using the element annotation `@Consumption.valueHelpDefinition`.
      - hide an element using the element annotation `@UI.hidden`.
  
2. Go to the behavior definition ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png) **`ZRAP100_R_TRAVELTP_###`** and add the addition **` parameter /dmo/a_travel_discount `** to the action definition. 

   The source code should now look as follows:
  
   ```
   action deductDiscount parameter /dmo/a_travel_discount result [1] $self;
   ```
      
   The abstract entity **`/dmo/a_travel_discount`** is used after the keyword **`parameter`** to specify the parameter structure. The present action will only have one parameter (**`discount_percent`**) as defined in the abstract entity.     
         
2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.
  
</details>
   

### Exercise 6.1.5: Adjust the Action Method

> You will now adjust the implementation of the business logic for the instance non-factory action **`deductDiscount`** with the input parameter **`deduct_discount`** in the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**.
>
> Only entered values greater than `0` and lower than `100` will be allowed.

> ℹ **Info**:  
> Depending on the type of action, the importing parameter **`keys`** has different components.
> The parameter structure **`%param`** for parameter input is imported by action with parameters. The parameter structure is used to access the passed values of the input parameters: **`deduct_discount`** in the present scenario - i.e. *`%param-deduct_discount`*.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Go to your behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`** and adjust the action method **`deductDiscount`**.

   To adjust the current logic, you will have to retrieve the passed discount values from the parameter structure **`%param`** and check their validity.
    
   The required adjustments of the current business logic:
   1. For all passed _Travel_ instances: Read and check the validity of the specified discount values from the parameter structure **`%param`**, and remove invalid ones: 0 < `%param-deduct_discount` <= 100 
   2. Implement the custom logic to determine the new values: The discounted booking must be calculated for each instance according to the respective **`%param-deduct_discount`** value - instead of the fix discount (30%).  
   
   Replace the current method implementation with the code snippet provided below. Do not forget to replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID. 
   
   You can use the **ABAP Pretty Printer** (**Ctrl+F1**) to format your source code.
      
   ```ABAP

## Exercises 6.2: Add the Instance-bound Factory Action `copyTravel`
[^Top of page](#introduction)

> Now, you will define, implement, and expose the action **`copyTravel`**, an instance-bound factory action used to copy one or more `travel` instances and creates new instances based on the copied data. A new travel ID is assigned to a new travel instance by the unmanaged internal early numbering. 

### Exercise 6.2.1: Define the Factory Action 

> Define the instance factory action **`copyTravel`** in the behavior definition.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
1. Go to the behavior definition ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_R_TRAVELTP_###`** and insert the following code snippet after the action defined in the previous step.
   
   ```ABAP   
   factory action copyTravel [1];
   ```
   
   The result should look like this:
   
   <!-- ![Travel BO Behavior Definition](images/n11a.png) -->
   <img src="images/n11a.png" alt="Travel BO Behavior Definition" width="60%">    
         
   **Short explanation**:  
   For factory actions, the same rules apply as for instance non-factory actions with the following differences:
   - Instance factory actions are specified with the keyword **`factory action`** before its name.
   - Output parameters are not allowed. Factory actions always produce one new BO entity instance with possible child entity instances. It is therefore not necessary to specify the **`result`** parameter.
   - The cardinality must always be **`[1]`** for factory actions.   
   - The result of a factory action is returned in the implicit response parameter **`mapped`** by a mapping between the BDEF derived type **`%cid`** and the key of the newly created entity instance.

### Exercise 6.2.2: Implement the Factory Action

> Implement the instance factory action **`coyTravel`** in the base BO behavior pool.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. First declare the required method in the behavior pool.
  
   Go to the behavior definition ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_R_TRAVELTP_###`**, set the cursor on the action name, **`copyTravel`**, and press **Ctrl+1** to open the **Quick Assist** view. 
   
   Select the entry _**`Add method for action copyTravel of entity zrap100_r_traveltp_### ...`**_ in the view to add the required method to the local handler class.     
      
   The result should look like this: 
   
   ![Travel BO Behavior Definition](images/n12a.png)    

2. Go to the declaration part of the local handler class of the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**, set the cursor on the method name, **`copyTravel`**, press **F2**, and examine the full method interface.  
   
   ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/n13.png)          

3. Implement the factory action **`copyTravel`** in the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png) **`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**.

   > ℹ **Info**:   
   > The implementation method of a factory action imports the parameter structure **`%param`** which has the  component **`%is_draft`**. This component can be used by calling EML APIs to indicates the state of the new instance to be created:
   > - `%is_draft` = `00` : New instance must be created as active instance - i.e., must be persisted. 
   > - `%is_draft` = `01` : New instance must be created as draft instance - i.e., will first be only stored in the draft table.   
   
   The logic consists of the following steps:    
   1. Remove all _travel_ instances with initial ID and read the data from the transfered _travel_ keys to be copied.   
   2. Fill in a travel container (itab) with all the new _travel_ instances to be created. The copied data are adjusted as neeeded.      
      - The component **`%param-%is_draft`** indicating the state of the new entity have to be evaluated - and the state of the new instances set accordingly.   
      - In the present exercise, we will adjust the begin date (`BeginDate`) and the end date (`EndDate`) due to the implemented validation `validateDates` and set the overall status of new `travel` instances to `Open` (`O`).   
   3. Create new _Travel_ instances with the EML statement **`MODIFY ENTITIES...CREATE`** which returns  the mapped data.    
   4. Set the result set in the **`mapped`** structure - especially in the internal table **`mapped-travel`** for the present example.   
   
   For that, replace the current method implementation with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID.   
   
   ```ABAP

## \[⚠OPTIONAL\] Exercise 6.3: Add the Instance Actions `acceptTravel` and `rejectTravel`
[^Top of page](#introduction)

In this step, you will define, implement, and expose two instance-bound non-factory actions for the `Travel` entity, `acceptTravel` and `rejectTravel`. These actions will be used to set the overall status of one or more given _Travel_ instances to `Accepted` (`A`) and `Rejected` (`X`) respectively.
           
> ⚠ **Optional exercise**:
> The non-factory instance ations  `acceptTravel` and `rejectTravel` defined and implemented in this exercise are similar to the one implemented in the exercise 6.1 (`deductDiscount`). They have been added to this document just to offer more functionalities to play with on the _Travel_ app.
> 
> If you are running out of time, we recommand you go ahead with the next exercise or copy the source code from the provided solution objects provided in the [ **Appendix** section](#Appendix).           
           
### Exercise 6.3.1: Define the Actions

> First, define the instance non-factory actions **`acceptTravel`** and **`rejectTravel`** in the behavior definition of the _Travel_ entity.  

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
1. Go to your behavior definition ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_R_TRAVELTP_###`** and define both actions.
   
   For that, insert the following code snippet after the defined validations as shown on the screenshot below.
   
   ```
   action acceptTravel result [1] $self;
   action rejectTravel result [1] $self;   
   ```      
   
   ![Travel BO Behavior Definition](images/n.png)      

2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

3. Now, declare the required method in behavior implementation class with the ADT Quick Fix.

   Set the cursor on one of the action names, **`acceptTravel`** or **`rejectTravel`**, and press **Ctrl+1** to open the **Quick Assist** view.
  
   Select the entry **`Add all 2 missing methods of entity zrap100_r_traveltp_### ...`** to add both methods to the local handler class `lcl_handler` of the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**. 
      
   ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/n2.png)

You are through with the definition of both actions. Go ahead with the implementations of the two inserted method in the behavior pool.

   </details>

### Exercise 6.3.2: Implement the Action Methods

> Now implement the required action methods in the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`** of the _Travel_ entity.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
   
1. You can check the interfaces of the methods **`acceptTravel`** and **`rejectTravel`** in the declaration part of the local handler class in the behavior pool ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_BP_TRAVELTP_###`**. They are similar to the one of the action method **`deductDiscount`**.
  
   For that, set the cursor on one of the method name, press **F2** to open the **ABAP Element Info** view, and examine the full method interface.  

   ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/n3.png)      
   
    Go ahead with the implementation.  

2. Implement the action **`acceptTravel`** in the implementation part of the local handler class.   
   The action is used to set the value of the field **`OverallStatus`** to **_Accepted_** (**`A`**). 
   
   The logic consists of the following steps:  
   1. Implement the custom logic to determine the new values; **_Accepted_** (**`A`**) in the present scenario.  
   2. Modify the relevant fields of the _travel_ instances; here only the field `OverallStatus` must be updated.  
   3. Read the whole data of the updated instances from the buffer to fill the action result parameter.   
 
   For that, replace the current method implementation with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID. You can make use of the **F1 Help** for more information about the EML statements and other ABAP constructs.
   
   <pre lang="ABAP">

       result = VALUE #( FOR travel IN travels ( %tky   = travel-%tky
                                                 %param = travel ) ).
     ENDMETHOD.
   </pre>
   
   Your source code should look like this:
   
   ![Travel BO Behavior Pool](images/n4.png)
   
   **Short explanation**:  
   - The provided implementation is mass-enabled. This is recommended. 
   - The EML statement **`MODIFY ENTITIES ... UPDATE FIELDS`** is used to update specific fields of the instances.     
   - The internal tables are filled inline using the constructor operator **`VALUE`** which made the need for explicit declaration obsolete.       
   - The EML statement **`READ ENTITIES ... ALL FIELDS WITH CORRESPONDING`** is used to read all fields of the updated instances from the buffer to fill the input paramter `result`.      

3. Implement the action  **`rejectTravel`** which is used to set the value of the field **`OverallStatus`** to **`Rejected`** (**`X`**). The business logic is similar to the one of the `acceptTravel` method.
   
   For that, replace the current method implementation with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID.

   <pre lang="ABAP">

### Exercise 6.3.3: Expose and Test the Actions 
> Now, you will expose the actions in the BO behavior projection and enrich the UI semantics in the CDS metadata extension to add appropriate button to the _Travel_ App.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Expose the actions in the BO behavior projection.
   
   Go to your behavior projection ![bdef icon](images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP100_C_TRAVELTP_###`** 
and insert the following code snippet as shown on the screenshot below. 
         
   ```
   use action acceptTravel;
   use action rejectTravel;
   ```

   Your source code should look like this:
   
   ![Travel BO Behavior Projection](images/b6.png)

2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

   The actions are yet ready to be consumed on the UI, but they also need to be explicitly placed on the UI. 

3. Enhance UI semantics of the UI service to make the actions visible on the list report page and the object page; with the labels `Accept Travel` and `Reject Travel` specified. 

   For that, go to your CDS metadata extension ![ddlx icon](images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP100_C_TRAVELTP_###`** 
   and uncomment the relevant code lines in the `@UI` annotations block placed before the element **`OverallStatus`** 
   as shown on the screenshot below.     
   
   ![Travel Metadata Extension](images/b7.png)

4. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

5. You can now preview and test your enhanced Fiori elements app. The actions should now appear on the UI. 
   
   For example, select a `Travel` record with the overall status _Open_ and press on the action button _**Accept Travel**_ or  _**Reject Travel**_. The overall status should now be _**Accepted**_ or _**Rejected**_. 
    
   ![Travel App Preview](images/preview9.png)

## Summary
[^Top of page](#introduction)

Now that you've... 
- defined different types of instance actions in the behavior definition - i.e simple action, action with input parameter, and factory action, 
- implement them in the behavior implementation, 
- expose them on the BO projection layer, i.e. behavior projection and metadata extension, and 
- preview and test the enhanced Fiori elements app,

you can continue with the next exercise – **\[Optional\] [Exercise 7: Enhance the BO Behavior – Dynamic Feature Control](../ex7/readme.md)**

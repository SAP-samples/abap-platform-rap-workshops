# \[optional\] Exercises 8: Write an ABAP Unit Test for the RAP BO 

## Introduction 
In the previous exercise, you've implemented the dynamic instance feature control for some of the standard and non-standard operations of the _Travel_ entity. (see [Exercise 7](../ex7/readme.md)).

In the present exercise, you will write scenario tests for your business object to verify its transactional behavior as a whole. You will write an ABAP Unit test with the Entity Manipulation Language (EML). The scenario to be tested in the present exercise is the creation and manipulation of a new _travel_ instance.

### About ABAP Unit Testing

Ensuring the high quality of applications has a very high priority in the whole software development lifecycle. As an application developer, you want to be able to write, for example, unit, scenario and integration tests to verify the application behavior as a whole. The ABAP platform offers different mechanisms and frameworks to achieve this. The main options here are ABAP Unit Tests und the ABAP Test Cockpit.

Writing ABAP Unit tests is the way to provide high quality software, which can be easily evolved over time without introducing regressions. In methodologies, like extreme programming and test driven development, the role of unit testing is even more important. 

ABAP Unit is the state-of-the-art unit testing framework for ABAP. It's embedded into the ABAP programming language which supports you in writing unit tests. In ADT you have various possibilities to execute the unit tests and to evaluate the results concerning functional correctness and code coverage.

### Simplified Runtime flow of ABAP Unit Test Classes

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

The ABAP Unit framework has standard special methods which needs to be implemented to set up and destroy a given test cofiguration.
- The standard special static methods of the test configuration **`class_setup()`** and **`class_teardown()`**.
  - **`class_setup()`**: This setup method is executed once before all tests of the class. It is used to setup the test environment.
  - **`class_teardown()`**: This teardown method is executed once after all tests of the test class are executed. It is used to destroy the test environment.
- The standard special instance methods of the test configuration: **`setup()`** and **`teardown()`**.
  - **`setup()`**: This method is executed before each individual test or before each execution of a test method. It is used, for example, to reset the test doubles before the execution of each test method.
  - **`teardown()`**: This method is executed after each individual test or after each execution of a test method. It will be used to rollback any changes in involved entities 

Below is a simplified representation of the runtime flow of ABAP Unit test classes. 

ABAP Unit test methods: **`<test method>()`** represents each unit test method for a given code under test (CUT). Such method is identifiable by the addition **`FOR TESTING`** in the method interface.

## Exercise 8.1: Create the ABAP Unit Test Class
[^Top of page](#)

> Create the test class ![class icon](images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP100_TC_TRAVEL_EML_###`** in your previously exercise package.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Right-click on your package ![package icon](images/adt_package.png)**`ZRAP100_###`** and choose **New > ABAP Class** from the context menu.      
 
2. Maintain the required information (`###` is your group ID) and click **Next >**.
   - Name: **`ZRAP100_TC_TRAVEL_EML_###`**
   - Description: _**`BO Test with EML`**_    

3. Assign a transport request and choose **Finish** to create the new ABAP class.

   ![Test Class](images/testclass01.png)

4. Specify the new global ABAP class as an ABAP Unit test class and also specify the test relation to the behavior definition (**`BDEF`**) of your _Travel_ BO entity **`ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###`**.
       
   For that, insert the addition **`FOR TESTING RISK LEVEL HARMLESS DURATION SHORT`** after the addition **`CREATE PPUBLIC`** (just before the **`.`**) of the class definition to enable the class for ABAP Unit testing.
   
   ```ABAP   
   FOR TESTING
   RISK LEVEL HARMLESS
   DURATION SHORT   
   ```
   
   Then add the ABAP Doc comment provided as code snippet below at the top of class editor to specify the test relation with your behavior definition **`ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###`** (TADIR entry: `R3TR BDEF`). Replace the placeholder `###` with your group ID.
   
   > **Info**: In ABAP Unit testing, test relations allow the tests of a given object to be executed from the referenced object. In the present example, you will execute the test for your RAP BO in the separate test class. It is also possible to write ABAP Unit tests directly in the behavior implementation classes. 
   
   ```ABAP
   "! @testing BDEF:ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###
   ```
   
   Your source code should look like this:

## Exercise 8.2: Enhance the Test Class Definition
[^Top of page](#)

> Enhance the ABAP Unit test class definition with all the needed methods.  
> You will declare the needed special ABAP unit instance and static methods, and the test method for the code under test (_CUT_).

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Insert the code snippet provided below under the **`PRIVATE SECTION.`** statement in the class definition.  
  
  Mock data for the _Agency_ and _Customer_ entities are needed in the present test scenario.
   
   ```ABAP
       CLASS-DATA:
         cds_test_environment TYPE REF TO if_cds_test_environment,
         sql_test_environment TYPE REF TO if_osql_test_environment,
         begin_date           TYPE /dmo/begin_date,
         end_date             TYPE /dmo/end_date,
         agency_mock_data     TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/agency,
         customer_mock_data   TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/customer.
       
       CLASS-METHODS:
         class_setup,    " setup test double framework
         class_teardown. " stop test doubles
      METHODS:
         setup,          " reset test doubles      
         teardown.       " rollback any changes
         
      METHODS:
         " CUT: create with action call and commit
         create_with_action FOR TESTING RAISING cx_static_check.
   ```
       
   An error will be displayed in the ABAP editor due to the missing method bodies in the class implementations.  
   
2. Add the method bodies via ADT quick fix.    
    
   For that, set your cursor on the method name **`class_setup`**, press **Ctrl+1** to display the **Quick Assist** view, and select the entry _**`+ Add 5 unimplemented methods`**_ from the pop-up menu to add the empty method bodies in the class implementation section.

   Your source code should now look like:
   
   ![Test Class](images/testclass03.png) 
   
    **Short explanation**:
      - Various static attributes for the test doubles and the mock data  
        -	**`cds_test_environment`**: The reference object for the CDS TDF (**`if_cds_test_environment`**) which is used to provide test doubles for the _travel_ CDS entity of the base BO view. The CDS test doubles will be used for _read_ operations.  
        -	**`sql_test_environment`**: The reference object for the ABAP SQL TDF (**`if_osql_test_environment`**) is used for stubing the additional needed database tables. The database test doubles will be used for _write_ operations.          
      - The ABAP unit framework standard special methods of the test configuration are specified: **`setup`**, **`teardown`**, **`class_setup`**, and **`class_teardown`**.
      -  The method **`create_with_action()`** is the unit test method for our CUT. Test methods are easily identifiable by the addition **`FOR TESTING`** in the method signature.

> Implement the special static methods **`class_setup`** and **`class_teardown`**,  and the special instance method **`setup`** required by the ABAP unit framework.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Implement the static method **`class_setup`** which is used to setup the test doubles environment and prepare the test data.       
    
   Replace the method body with the code snippet below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID. 
   
   Use the **Pretty Printer** (**Shift+F1**) to format your source code and save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes.
      
   ```ABAP
    METHOD class_setup.
      " create the test doubles for the underlying CDS entities
      cds_test_environment = cl_cds_test_environment=>create_for_multiple_cds(
                        i_for_entities = VALUE #(
                          ( i_for_entity = 'ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_###' ) ) ).
                          
      " create test doubles for additional used tables.
      sql_test_environment = cl_osql_test_environment=>create(
      i_dependency_list = VALUE #( ( '/DMO/AGENCY' )
                                   ( '/DMO/CUSTOMER' ) ) ).

      " prepare the test data
      begin_date = cl_abap_context_info=>get_system_date( ) + 10.
      end_date   = cl_abap_context_info=>get_system_date( ) + 30.

      agency_mock_data   = VALUE #( ( agency_id = '070041' name = 'Agency 070041' ) ).
      customer_mock_data = VALUE #( ( customer_id = '000093' last_name = 'Customer 000093' ) ).
    ENDMETHOD.   
   ```   

   Your source code should look like this:
   
   ![Test Class](images/ex8_2.png)    
  
2. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes.

3. Implement the ABAP Unit framework standard static method **`class_teardown`** which is used to stop the test doubles at the end of the test class execution.
    
   Replace the method body with the code snippet provided below, format your code your source code, and save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes.

   ```ABAP
    METHOD class_teardown.
      " remove test doubles
      cds_test_environment->destroy(  ).
      sql_test_environment->destroy(  ).
    ENDMETHOD.
   ```   
   
   Your source code should look like this:
   
   ![Test Class](images/testclass05.png)


4.	Implement the special instance method **`setup`** which is used to reset the test doubles and insert the test data before the execution of the test method - or of each test method of a test class in general.    

    Insert the code snippet below in the appropriate method implementation as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
       METHOD setup.
         " clear the test doubles per test
         cds_test_environment->clear_doubles(  ).
         sql_test_environment->clear_doubles(  ).
         " insert test data into test doubles
         sql_test_environment->insert_test_data( agency_mock_data   ).
         sql_test_environment->insert_test_data( customer_mock_data ).
       ENDMETHOD.
    ``` 

    The source code should look like this:

    ![Test Class](images/testclass06.png)


5. Implement the special instance method **`teardown`** which is used to rollback any changes in the involved entities after the execution the test method.

    Replace the method body with the code snippet provided below and format your code your source code.

    ```ABAP
     METHOD teardown.
       " clean up any involved entity

1. Implement the test method **`create_with_action`**.  
   
   Insert the code snippet provided below in the method body and replace all occurrences of **`###`** with your group ID.

   âš **Attention**âš :  
   In case you've defined and implemented the instance actions **`acceptTravel`** in the [Exercise 6](../ex6/readme.md)_), then uncomment the six (6) related code lines in the inserted source code.  
   
   ```ABAP

      ENDMETHOD.
   ```

   The source code should look like this:

   ![Test Class](images/ex8_3.png)
         
   **Short explanation:**  
   - The complete CUT is a complex EML Statement comprising a **`MODIFY ENTITIES`** statement **`CREATE`** and **`EXECUTE`** additions, and a **`COMMIT ENTITIES`** statement.
   - The class **`CL_ABAP_UNIT_ASSERT`** is used in test method implementations to check/assert the test assumptions. It offers various static methods for the purposes - e.g. `assert_equals()`, `assert_initial()`, `assert_not_initial()`, and `assert_differs()`.
   - Block (1) 
     - CUT: **`MODIFY ENTITIES`** statement, including the following
       - a **`CREATE`** addition which creates a _travel_ instance (root).
       - an **`EXECUTE`** addition which calls the action **`acceptTravel`** on the _travel_ instance.
       - an **`EXECUTE`** addition which calls the action **`deductDiscount`** on the _travel_ instance. 
     - First assertion block on the result parameters - before committing the changes 
       - An assertion used to check for eventual failures and messages during the creation of the instances and the execution of the action. 
       - An assertion used to check the returned **`mapped`** table for the created _travel_ and _booking_ instances. 
   - Block (2)
        - CUT:  **`COMMIT ENTITIES`** statement which persists the changes to the database (test doubles).
        - The second assertion block checks for an eventual failure of the performed commit by examinating the return parameters **`commit_failed`** and **`commit_reported`**.
   - Block (3)
        - Third assertion block to check the successful persistence of the data in the test doubles. 
        - For that, the committed data is first read via a **`SELECT`** statement on the base BO view **`ZRAP100_R_TravelTP_####`**; The data is read from the configure test double.
        - Various assertion checks are performed. Please read the comment lines in the code snippet for more explanation.

# RAP - Managed BO Runtime Implementation 

Find hands-on exercises related to core functionalities when building greenfield scenarios with the managed implementation of the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) in this folder.

## RAP100 - Build a transactional Fiori elements App with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) 
The application built in this exercise is a managed Implementation with internal unmanaged early numbering (semantic key). One of the standard RAP Generator is used in this workshop.

## AD164 - Get started with ABAP Cloud for classic ABAP developers
In this workshop, you’ll get hands-on experience with ABAP Cloud and grasp how the new concepts work. Building on your knowledge of classic ABAP, you’ll learn how to develop cloud-ready business apps and services. You'll use the ABAP RESTful application programming model (RAP) which is used for building transactional scenarios. Based on a practical scenario, you will rebuild an existing ALV-based app as an a modern SAP Fiori app with RAP, and extend it further with new capabilities.

## RAP110 - Build a transactional Fiori elements App with the RAP \[Intermediate Level\]
The application built in this exercise is based on a managed BO implementation with late numbering (semantic key). 
It is based on a managed Business Object (BO) with two BO nodes or entities, _Travel_ and _Booking_, and uses features such as Odata stream, virtual elements in CDS-based data model, late numbering, internal and determine instance actions, static default factory actions, side effects, functions, business events, and additional save.

## SAP Build and ABAP Cloud Basic Trial Offering
The Basic Trial offering for SAP Build has been extended with a new workbook called "Fusion Development with ABAP Cloud in SAP Build". Since SAP BTP ABAP Environment is part of the SAP Build offering we worked on creating a new workbook for the Basic Trial offering around SAP Build, that shows how developers can now create new ABAP Cloud projects, or work on existing ones, from the SAP Build lobby and then navigate to their ABAP development environment – the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT).

# RAP121 - Building SAP Fiori Apps in ABAP Cloud with GenAI

## Description
<!-- Please include SEO-friendly description -->

This repository contains the material for the hands-on session called **RAP121 - Building SAP Fiori Apps in ABAP Cloud with GenAi**.

ABAP Cloud is the development model for building clean core compliant apps, services, and extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP BTP ABAP Environment. ABAP Cloud covers different development scenarios such as transactional, analytical, integration, and enterprise search scenarios. The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) ist at the heart of ABAP Cloud for building transactional SAP Fiori apps, OData-based Web API, local APIs, and business events.

In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how generative AI can support the development of clean core compliant draft-enabled transactional SAP Fiori elements apps with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) as well as read-only SAP Fiori elements apps in ABAP Cloud. You will also learn how to define and raise business events in RAP-based applications that can be consumed locally or remotely via SAP Event Mesh for loosely coupled integration scenarios.

This hands-on tutorial applies to SAP BTP ABAP Environment systems with access to the [SAP AI Core](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-core).

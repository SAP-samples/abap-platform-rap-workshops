# Exercise 4: Developer extensibility

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement calls to the released API so that the users of the OnlineShop App can create purchase requisitions using your RAP business object `ZR_ONLINESHOP_###`

## Exercise 4.1: Add variable to global BDEF class zbp_r_onlineshop_###
[^Top of page](#)

 The called **API I_PurchaserequisitionTP** uses late numbering. When being called by our application it will only return a preliminary key **%pid**.
 
 In order to retrieve the final key in our application from this preliminary key we have to use the `CONVERT KEY` key word:     
 
 <pre>
 CONVERT KEY OF i_purchaserequisitiontp FROM <fs_pr_mapped>-%pid TO DATA(ls_pr_key).
 </pre>
 
 Since this conversion routine can only be called within the **save sequence** in the **save_modified()** method we have to change the behavior of our RAP business object to use either **unmanaged save** or **additional_save**.   

 Since we want to write back into the persistence of our own RAP business object we **MUST** use the **unmanaged save** approach.   

And in order to transfer the mapped premliminary key(s) from the interaction phase into the save sequence we have to store that data in a variable that is accessible from both, the local handler and the local saver class. This can be achieved by defining an appropriate class variable in the global part of the behavior implementation class.   

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
  We define a variable that will hold the response of our (to be implemented) API call in the behavior implementation class `zbp_r_onlineshop_###`.  

  <pre>

  CLASS zbp_r_onlineshop_### DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  ABSTRACT
  FINAL
  FOR BEHAVIOR OF zr_onlineshop_### .

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    CLASS-DATA mapped_purchase_requisition TYPE RESPONSE FOR MAPPED i_purchaserequisitiontp.
  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
  ENDCLASS.



  CLASS zbp_r_onlineshop_### IMPLEMENTATION.
  ENDCLASS.
  </pre>

 </details>

## Exercise 4.2: Add unmanaged save
[^Top of page](#)

As mentioned above we have to add the use of an unmanaged save to the behavior of our RAP business object since the API that we plan to call uses *late numbering*.

Navigate to the behavior definition `ZR_ONLINESHOP_###` either in the *Project Explorer* or by opening it as a development object using the short cut **Ctrl+Shift+A**.   

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

  1. Open the behavior definition and add the statement `with unmanaged save` right after the `authorization master ( global )` statement.   
     In addition uncomment the statement that specifies the persistent table of our RAP BO `//persistent table zaonlineshop_###` since it is not possible to use both statements in the same behavior definition.    
     
     > **Note:** 
     > When the code for your project has been pre-generated the behavior definition used an behavior implementation class on node level.  
     > For the **unmanaged save** a behavior implementation class has to be specified in the same line as the **managed** key word.
     > So you can replace the code as follows:    

<pre>
managed implementation in class ZBP_R_ONLINESHOP_### unique;
strict ( 2 );
with draft;

define behavior for ZR_ONLINESHOP_### alias OnlineShop
//implementation in class ZBP_R_ONLINESHOP_### unique
//persistent table zaonlineshop_###
draft table zdonlineshop_###
etag master LocalLastChangedAt
lock master total etag LastChangedAt
authorization master ( global )
with unmanaged save
</pre>

  2. Activate your changes.   

  3. After having activated your changes select the key word `unmanaged` and select **Ctrl + 1** to start the code assistant.   
     
     This will add a local saver class `lsc_zr_onlineshop_###` to the local classes of your behavior implementation class. The method `save_modified` is added to the DEFINITION and the IMPLEMENTATION section of this local class.   

     <pre>
     CLASS lsc_zr_onlineshop_### DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cl_abap_behavior_saver.
       PROTECTED SECTION.
       METHODS save_modified REDEFINITION.
     ENDCLASS.
     </pre>
     

  ![unmanaged save](images/500_unmanaged_save.png)  

  4. Implement the `save_modified()` method as follows:
  
<pre>
      METHOD save_modified.

    DATA : lt_online_shop_as        TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF zaonlineshop_###,
           ls_online_shop_as        TYPE                   zaonlineshop_###,
           lt_online_shop_x_control TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF zaonlineshop_x_###.

    IF create-onlineshop IS NOT INITIAL.
      lt_online_shop_as = CORRESPONDING #( create-onlineshop MAPPING FROM ENTITY ).
      INSERT zaonlineshop_### FROM TABLE @lt_online_shop_as.
    ENDIF.

    IF update IS NOT INITIAL.
      CLEAR lt_online_shop_as.
      lt_online_shop_as = CORRESPONDING #( update-onlineshop MAPPING FROM ENTITY ).
      lt_online_shop_x_control = CORRESPONDING #( update-onlineshop MAPPING FROM ENTITY ).
      MODIFY zaonlineshop_### FROM TABLE @lt_online_shop_as.
    ENDIF.
    IF delete IS NOT INITIAL.
      LOOP AT delete-onlineshop INTO DATA(onlineshop_delete).
        DELETE FROM zaonlineshop_### WHERE order_uuid = @onlineshop_delete-OrderUUID.
        DELETE FROM zdonlineshop_### WHERE orderuuid = @onlineshop_delete-OrderUUID.
      ENDLOOP.
    ENDIF.

  ENDMETHOD.

</pre>

  5. Create a structure `zaonlineshop_x_###`.

     - Right click on your package and select **New > Other ABAP Repository Object**  
     
     - Search for `Structure`

       ![unmanaged save](images/530_unmanaged_save.png)  
       
     - Enter the required values and press **Next**  

       Name: `ZAONLINESHOP_X_###`  
       Description: `Helper structure`  

       ![unmanaged save](images/540_unmanaged_save.png)

     - Select a transport and press **Finish**  

     - Use the following code template

<pre>
  @EndUserText.label : 'Helper structure'
  @AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
  define structure zaonlineshop_x_### {
  order_id              : abap_boolean;
  ordered_item          : abap_boolean;
  material_group        : abap_boolean;
  price                 : abap_boolean;
  total_price           : abap_boolean;
  currency              : abap_boolean;
  order_quantity        : abap_boolean;
  delivery_date         : abap_boolean;
  purchase_requisition  : abap_boolean;
  pr_status             : abap_boolean;
  pr_creation_date      : abap_boolean;
  notes                 : abap_boolean;
  created_by            : abap_boolean;
  created_at            : abap_boolean;
  last_changed_by       : abap_boolean;
  last_changed_at       : abap_boolean;
  local_last_changed_at : abap_boolean;
  }
</pre>

   - Activate the structure

   - Change the coding in your BDEF

     The statement `mapping for ZAONLINESHOP_###` must be changed to `mapping for ZAONLINESHOP_### control zaonlineshop_x_### corresponding`

     <pre>     
     mapping for ZAONLINESHOP_### control zaonlineshop_x_### corresponding
     </pre>

     ![unmanaged save](images/550_unmanaged_save.png)

   - Activate your coding in local saver class in your behavior definition class

 </details>

## Exercise 4.3: Add and implement an action
[^Top of page](#)

We have now prepared everything so that we can add an action to our RAP business object that will trigger the creation of a purchase requisition based on an order that has been placed in the OnlineShop.   

In the following you have to perform the following steps 

- Add the action `createPurchaseRequisition` to the behavior definition 
- Implementation of the method `createPurchaseRequisition` in your behavior implementation class   
- Enable action in the behavior definition projection 
- Add UI annotations in the metadata extension file to make the action button visible in your Fiori Elements application

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Open the behavior definition

2. Add the following statement in your BDEF

   <pre>
   action createPurchaseRequisition result [1] $self;
   </pre>

3. Click on the action name and press **Ctrl+1** to start the quick assist

   This will add the following method to the local handler class of your behavior definition which will be executed when the button of our action is pressed.  
   
   <pre>
   METHODS createPurchaseRequisition FOR MODIFY
      IMPORTING keys FOR ACTION OnlineShop~createPurchaseRequisition RESULT result.
   </pre>

4. Implementation of method `createPurchaseRequisition` 
   
   The implementation of the method `createPurchaseRequisition` reuses large parts of the coding that we have used in the test class in **Exercise 1**.  
  
   In the implementation we first fill some internal tables that serve as a payload for the EML call that will create one or more purchase requisitions.  
   The preliminary id %pid that is returned via the mapped table from the API that was called is stored in a variable in the global behavior implementation class.  
   
   <pre>zbp_r_onlineshop_###=>mapped_purchase_requisition-purchaserequisition = mapped_create_pr-purchaserequisition.</pre>  
   
   The code then updates the fields `OverallStatus`, `OverallStatusIndicator` and `PurchRqnCreationDate` of our RAP business object. This way it is also ensured that the save_sequence is triggered where the `CONVERT KEY` statement is used to retrieve the final key, the `PurchaseRequisitionID`.  
   
   The action finally returns via the return return parameter a table of UUID based keys of OnlineShop entities that have been processed.  
   
    
  <pre>
  METHOD createPurchaseRequisition.

    DATA: purchase_requisitions      TYPE TABLE FOR CREATE I_PurchaserequisitionTP,
          purchase_requisition       TYPE STRUCTURE FOR CREATE I_PurchaserequisitionTP,
          purchase_requisition_items TYPE TABLE FOR CREATE i_purchaserequisitionTP\_PurchaseRequisitionItem,
          purchase_requisition_item  TYPE STRUCTURE FOR CREATE i_purchaserequisitiontp\\purchaserequisition\_purchaserequisitionitem,

          purchase_reqn_item_text    TYPE STRUCTURE FOR CREATE I_PurchaseReqnItemTP\_PurchaseReqnItemText,
          update_lines               TYPE TABLE FOR UPDATE ZR_OnlineShop_###\\OnlineShop,
          update_line                TYPE STRUCTURE FOR UPDATE ZR_OnlineShop_###\\OnlineShop,

5. Enable action in the projection view

   Add the following code in your projection BDEF. 

   <pre>
   use action createPurchaseRequisition;
   </pre>

6. Make the action visible by uncommenting the following lines in your meta data extension file

<pre>
  @UI.lineItem:       [{ position: 84, label: 'Purchase requisition nbr.', importance: #HIGH },
            { type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'createPurchaseRequisition', label: 'Create purchase requisition' } ] //Submit Order | Create purchase requisition|
  @UI.identification: [
                       { type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'createPurchaseRequisition',
                         label: 'Create purchase requisition' }]  //Submit Order | Create purchase requisition|
  @UI.fieldGroup: [{ qualifier: 'PurchReq', position: 22, label: 'Purchase requisition number' }]  //PurchReq
  PurchaseRequisition;
</pre>
  
 
  </details>

## Exercise 4.4: Add the convert key statement to your local saver class

The `save_modified`  method will be enhanced such that we check whether any preliminary key
`zbp_r_onlineshop_###=>mapped_purchase_requisition` has been saved in the helper variable in the global behavior implementation class by our action implementation.   

We add this implementation after the implementation of the **create**, **update** and **delete** statements.  

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Open the method `save_modified` in your local saver class. 

2. Add the following coding to retrieve the semantic key from the called API.  

  <pre>

  > Before checking the results in the ADT Fiori Elements preview make sure to clear the cache by pressing **F12** and by selecting **clear cache and refresh**. Otherwise you might run into the issue that the button of the action is visible but not functional.   

 
  1. Open the Fiori Elements Preview of your Online Shop App and create an order. 

  2. Press on the button to create a purchase requisition.
